# Contributing to Tic Tac Toe

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Tic Tac Toe.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We welcome contributions to improve documentation as much as code. Feel free to suggest changes to the README, this CONTRIBUTING file, or any other help files.

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the game, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need most.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

## Pull Requests

PRs to our project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-reaching whitespace/formatting issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or added functionality (if a test suite exists).
- Address a single concern in the least amount of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or updates to the README for changes to interfaces and public APIs.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

## Setup

For anything more than a trivial fix, you'll likely need to setup your environment:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repo to your own machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.

## Making Changes

1. Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate PRs.
2. Write tests for your changes. This is not required, but it's helpful to prevent future regressions.
3. Write clear, descriptive commit messages. This will help others understand your changes and why they were made.
4. Please do not update the version number in your PR. This is done by the project maintainers.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repo.
2. Visit the repository on GitHub and click the "Pull request" button.
3. Fill out the form descriptions, linking the issues addressed.
4. The project maintainers will review your PR and either merge it, request changes, or close it with an explanation.

## After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repo.

## Final Notes

Contributions to this project are subject to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read and follow it.

Thank you for contributing!
